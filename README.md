# TeamSpiritScripts

Scripts that help you manage your hours on TeamSpirit !

## Usage

• Log in TeamSpirit  
• Go to the Timesheet page  
• Open the console (by pressing F12)  
• Open the file you want to use and copy paste the code in the console  

It's pretty primitive but it does the job, feel free to improve it!


### Notes on the autofill script

This is a really simple script, it will overwrite any hours that you have previously entered.
